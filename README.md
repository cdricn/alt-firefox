# Alternative Firefox Start Page
A Firefox extension that provides an alternate start page to allow more user customization.

## ToDo:
Remember to do ``npm run build`` first and reloading the temporary extension before running! </br>
Reloading the tab won't work. You need to open in a new tab. </br>
